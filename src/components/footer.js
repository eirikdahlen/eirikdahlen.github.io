                DISCLAIMER: These compendiums are written by me, and originally for me. Some will be in English
                and some will be in Norwegian. I do not claim that the content is 100% accurate, but it is what
                I learned during the courses and my opinion of what is correct. The curriculum may have changed
                since I did these courses myself. You are allowed to download the pdf-files, but not to edit
                the files in any way. Thank you!
